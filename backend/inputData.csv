Additionally, BCS can embrace innovation by encouraging employees to stay updated on technological advancements and invest in continuous training. A progressive work environment can be cultivated by implementing training frameworks, promoting career progression for all employees, and ensuring leadership commitment to inclusivity.

Everyone in BCS should be able to say what our unique offering is in an elevator pitch style. If we find this too difficult as an organisation, maybe we aren't coherent enough ti be effective and we should look seriously at our mission, charter and see how we should rationalise around this.
The profit first, social good second is a strong narrative and one that isn't helpful and actively closes off areas we want to influence. It often feels like we are playing different games, one very much fixed on the short term and one looking more at the longer term. Both important but there is a lack of dedicated support/time/resource or a clear strategy or leadership to help staff understand the journey between the two. 

BCS is still very much a collection of mini fiefdoms without a clear central purpose, a legacy issue and one there is an opportunity to change with a new CEO and a strong united and visible Exec.

This is not a dig at the Ops Team, as I think they are truly brilliant, but there was a clear failing in resource management throughout Summer 2022, with experienced and talented team members moving jobs internally to different teams in addition to a number of maternity leaves. Their roles were not backfilled quick enough and the lack of support has had a serious impact, not only on service levels to clients, but also on the sales support staff, as they assumed additional operational responsibilities that are still impacting the sales process and support provided to the sales team. So I would suggest acknowledging there was a failure, contingency planning via lessons learned so that the risk of something happening again is mitigated slightly, and then adequately staffing operations in line with the promised service level we sell to clients.

I also think we can make things better by improving commercial awareness throughout non-sales based teams. Institute is a charity, granted, but we still need clients and members and money coming in to keep the organisation a going concern and to invest in all the wonderful initiatives we launch that have real societal benefit. I still feel when sales communicate things internally, it is perceived as a whinge and not as the feedback from paying clients. "";}}","65.000"

Welcome to BCS booklet/section on website/portal - All your new starter paperwork, an acronym dictionary, who's who (copy of org chart), where to start on our website to find info, top websites to bookmark, short bite size training modules, maybe some modules from Early Careers course (as they were great to help get to know the business)

A better website UX - its big and can be confusing, clearer signposting, personalised content based on what you've already been looking at.

Simplify and standardise our processes - so we have clear direction. Feels like over the years departments have created their own way of doing things, new starters come in and then create their own version but is that the right and most efficient way? would be good to have one that we all follow

Sharepoint tidy up - one way of using across the board and more organisation, it is a mind field trying to find things and knowing whats up to date etc and again, everyone has their own way of doing things. 

Ensure systems talk to one another - pearson vue, salesforce, power bi - numbers aren't always accurate. 

Salesforce - everyone to use the same version so we are consistent and ensure we all use. This should be the way we generate reports for senior management. 

Sales team to have visibility of queries that have been submitted via Zendesk, for example when clients call their AM to check status of something raised, we don't know at what stage of process CPQT may be at in dealing with the issue. We have to call that team to ask for an update to then call client back to relay info, if we could see some high level data we update the client there and then so would save time.

A #MakingBCSBetter committee - like the social team, but have a person nominated from each department who get to be the voice of that area/the go to person - that team then meet with CEO and senior team once/twice a year to help continue to raise challenges/discuss opportunities as to how to bring the company together more

Also consider investing in using Salesforce for its intended purpose rather than an order processing platform. They way we use it is expensive and hugely under-utilises the potential of the technology, with no clear reports or intelligence coming from it and no real insight into the customer journey.

We had a meeting asking us how BCS can save money, I don't think anyone raised the point of making Swindon offices smaller, the two floors are never at full capacity, One floor would be enough as all 250 colleagues are never there at the same time and can work from home, saving on travel, petrol, parking costs, taking into account the savings it would have on our green/ carbon footprint, travelling to Swindon by car has become a nightmare and dangerous.  Another way to save is at  London offices, there should be no catering for free events, the one year we were told that &pound;120000 was spent, taking into account this was before covid, unless the groups bring in  sponsorship or make the event chargeable there should not be any food involved for the night events, tea, coffee, biscuits should be sufficient, as the delegates are supposed to be there for the talk not the food, we have found a few groups/branch seem to focus on the food.

This is de motivating as most part time people work above and beyond their hours but they are always penalised. I don't feel part time people are treated as fairly with staff benefits as full time employees are. Also getting the bonus a whole financial year later isn't great for staff moral.

2. BCS stars is a over complicated process- I would love to to simply give someone praise but there is no way to do this without filling out a BCS stars form which think you get points and unless you get lot's of nominations the points are useless. Or, we should do something like we use to with staff awards and make it more of a worthy thing to win or get? I don't think enough people get praise as the form is off putting. Also teams should be able to get nominated or praise.

3. Career planning- I put forward a number of areas I would like to grow in and was told there is nothing at BCS to support what I said. SO in my eyes why say it's for staff to create their own opportunities when they cannot? This just leads to good people leaving or being de motivated.

We are one organisation that, without maximum effort, will not achieve the best results - yet it feels like a fight between departments sometimes to agree on priorities.  Must find a way to better unify the direction of the business with a philosophy that is clear to all employees -  we must go forward to recruit based on that same philosophy - there are some shocking attitudes in the business that are not here every day to achieve as 'one team' or they simply don't understand the big picture.  There is a notion that its impossible to fire someone these days - people need to be measurably held accountable to their job description and action must be taken against employees in this organisation that do not contribute to our success in a meaningful enough way that balances against their salary.  There are some brilliant people in this organisation that are a pleasure to work with - but across the business there is also an undercurrent of gripe against a number of employees that don't appear to be delivering value in their role.  It sets a sour and resentful tone for employees who give their all and remain unrewarded.  I work with a number of people in this organisation who, if measured against performance targets, would be seen to far exceed and flag themselves within the business as people that should have greater responsibility and, in turn, would contribute to delivering greater successes.

To clarify my answers to the questions:
- I do not know if anything will be done following the survey's feedback, as the results of the survey we are provided with are summarized - we do not have the precise answers everyone gave, to these text boxes in particular - START SHARING THE WHOLE SURVEY RESPONSES AND NOT JUST A SUMMARY

- I do not know if as an organisation we act on customers' feedback as I don't get to see all customers' feedback - either the question is irrelevant. Or WE NEED TO START SHARING ALL CUSTOMERS' FEEDBACK

- I believe what the senior management is saying, I just think they don't communicate often enough, especially in a lockdown situation, where we all work in silos. - SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO COMMUNICATE MORE FREQUENTLY (twice a year is not enough - short briefings regurlarly would be better - I would have sent something on the 4th January for example, when all was so uncertain, if only to say that they were meeting, taking everything on board and will come back to us with more details... or similar)

- I don't think the senior management is aware of the issues I face in  my particular job - in other circumstances I would have advised to start something like regurlarly sitting down next to and talking to people they never speak to usually, possibly doing their job for a day. And maybe re-iterate monthly. Obviously, a bit unpractical at the moment....

- I don't know if we take enough risks in the organisation, as I am not in a position to know. I am not sure it is the moment to do so that said.

Making simple tasks frustrating through complicated internal systems e.g. paying for a one time service requires adding that business as a supplier
Confusing hub of employee finances; NetSuite
Confusing internal information hub; SharePoint
Sometimes a lot of people in the way of achieving a task
Reduce message relaying (from customers/members) in and between departments
Allowing non-technical voices too much liberty to decide over technical principles; sometimes non-technical staff/members lower standards, and efficiency in order to accommodate them; they should be able to defend the resulting standards of their decision before it being employed, and I don't think it should be employed if the resulting standards are poor; this would be resolved if technical voices had more control over technical processes and other staff/members were more focused on their best areas instead of covering many areas; often it is the guests who are the final ones to experience the results of this
Quality suffers to accommodate non-technical staff and members involved in the process
Unstructured/unclear interaction between membership; must regain control of some aspects of membership experience and begin establishing/clarifying  procedures to be followed
Mildly disordered, unguided and confusing membership experience
In some instances, unclear package of what we have to offer to membership
Basing too much of our communications technology and work procedures/systems on emails
Internal meetings without work objectives
Sometimes a lack of workforce at important times and an excess in unimportant times
A theme of  lack of understanding of basic IT and tech knowledge throughout the organization and membership, yet involved in many processes which results in loads of avoidable problems (attention away from driving standards); I think get people doing what they are best at and focus people/simplify processes. E.g. A talented speaker must not need to worry about the technology that will underpin their speech and so should not be too involved in it, but there should be a team behind them to cover that"";i:2;s:298:""Continue venture into flexible working as may allow opportunities for more focused work and reduce passive work

Not consulting staff on things of interest:
example: office moves and where people sit, which machines we will be working on, additional screens, fixed desks or not ... Some people require quiet environments because of the nature of their tasks, others need a lot of teams interactions or are often on the phone. Managers have been vaguely consulted it seems, but in a general way, not in details, this at  the very beginning of the process. Eventually it is more a matter of being told, rather than asked. And staff haven't been specifically consulted either at all.

"3744","a:1:{s:8:""comment4"";a:3:{i:0;s:2799:""Comments on my answers:
14- the pay is fair: in my case it is, in a way; but as it hasn&acirc;€™t been really increased for several years, it has effectively decreased quite a lot. Last year&acirc;€™s slight re-adjustment due to good performance was nice, but as its percentage didn&acirc;€™t even reflect half of the actual inflation level, it was quite meaningless. Prices and taxes continue to increase, my salary doesn&acirc;€™t keep up with this. A whole readjustment of the pay scale, which hasn&acirc;€™t been done for years, could be useful too. 

17 &acirc;€“ Action taken on opportunities identified: maybe. Communication, especially at senior level, is still not adequate.

18- BCS as a great place to recommend: yes for it relative stability and nice colleagues, but not sure in general,  if we continue to hire and then get rid of people every couple of years&acirc;€&brvbar; We seem to have a high turn over

25- BCS as an innovative environment: no, we&acirc;€™re too slow to act, and still do the same old same old in the way we work, in what we produce. And the world is moving on. This is a bit worrying, especially in the actual context of Brexit to come. But we do talk a lot.


26 Changes made for the better: maybe.

27. Manage change well: not sure, see comments to 25

28- Staff can speak up: Theoretically yes, but no one (not many?) will. We do want to keep our jobs&acirc;€&brvbar; &eth;Ÿ˜Š 

29: We act on outside feedback: I don&acirc;€™t know. I couldn&acirc;€™t say

31- Opportunities for promotions: Possibly. It depends on where one works I suppose. And jobs are generally only available when someone goes. 

33- Quality of service improving: not sure, possibly.

34. Informed about how the company is doing: once or twice a year, yes. On a day-to-day, or week-to-week basis, no.
As said above this is especially worrying considering the country&acirc;€™s political state at the moment. Do we have plans B, C, &acirc;€&brvbar;?

37- Seniors managers aware of my day to day issues: most probably not. I would be surprised if they knew what I do on a day to day basis. In some companies senior managers actually come and do the job of some of their employees for a day, an afternoon, once or so a year. What a good idea! That should certainly give them a feel for what their staff is going through. On a basic level.

Start doing: 
more inter-department meetings. We don't know what others do, what their constraints are, they don't know ours; if we did perhaps that we could all help each.

Also do we actually provide services and products that customers really want? or products that we THINK they want? Do we talk (actually talk face to face, go to the London office or to local events to meet people etc) to our customers, members?
"";i:1;s:492:""Hiring more people if we can't guarantee existing staff with an increase of salary each year which at least is in line with the inflation.
Especially if it is to lay them off a year or 2  later......

Not communicate regarding external suppliers we use. Hence being charged extortionate prices sometimes. A standard pool of resources would be so useful.

And using agencies/suppliers from London and other major cities. Couldn't local people do the job as well, and at better prices?

Getting to know each other (and each other&acirc;€™s jobs) better. "";i:1;s:5876:""In no particular order, apart from the first item maybe:

Marketing: my biggest gripe is to have to beg for some marketing (and I mean regular marketing &acirc;€“ not once in a while marketing, when our colleague can fit it among her other activities) done for my products. We may have the best products in the world, if no-one knows they are there, no-one will buy them. How are we then expected to make our targets? We have 18 marketing people (not counting the web team and the brand managers) who for the most part seem dedicated to Institute activities. Activities which still bring back a much smaller income (if not a producing a real cost) compared to the L&amp;D&acirc;€™s activities. 
I understand that for saving reasons, a marketing director has not been reinstated. But the ship seems to be cruising without a captain (or the actual captain may be too busy to be able to put his full mind into it) ..

Brand: almost 10 years ago, we spent quite a lot of money on a brand revamp, which was &acirc;€œthe law&acirc;€ for a while and affected how all our products/communication looked. It would make us look/be more &acirc;€œprofessional&acirc;€. Then the team was dismantled, nobody really looked after anything, and we were back to doing a bit what we wanted, interpreting as we wished. The green shield is still there somewhere I suppose. Waste of money?
We seem to have had a re-work of some aspects of the brand recently, as I found out completely by chance. As this was never communicated to anyone. 

Facilities: talking of wasting money, over the years, we have seen multiple partitioning, dismantling, and repartitioning of various areas of the office, as well as the purchase of various pieces of equipment and furniture which not only seemed expensive but were never/don&acirc;€™t seem to be ever used (tall orange armchairs, green pods?) &acirc;€&brvbar; 

Staff training: this is always a very good idea (if we trained staff properly in house, would we need to use external agencies?). However doing it once in a blue moon is pointless, and a waste of money. People forget. Training needs to be done regularly to be efficient. Repeated several times a year, and not because it is the trend of the moment (the Agile training?). The insight training by the way was an excellent idea. However even for that one, my comments above apply.

Values: putting together a list of behaviours/thoughts and hoping all will abide by them is an illusion. And certainly is not enough to change a culture within an organization. All this must come and be lived by from the top down. And somehow I do not have the impression that it is the case.
And there is still a big gap Institute/L&amp;D. Those values at the moment are not changing this. What would maybe be a good idea would be to have people working together in small teams on projects; this was actually a very positive aspect of the Agile and Insight trainings, where for a while, people from both sides were communicating and working together on something. Getting to know each other (and each other&acirc;€™s jobs) better. 

Products teams: I hear that our products are too old, not properly maintained and don&acirc;€™t fit the market. They haven&acirc;€™t for a long time. Lots of products managers have come and gone. The oldest in place was hired in 2015 I believe. Some were even made redundant last autumn and those left are up to their eye balls with work. 
The strategy puzzles me here (is there any?). What have we been waiting for exactly?

Redundancies: we made people redundant in large numbers (several times for the last 10 years &acirc;€“ this doesn&acirc;€™t exactly inspire a lot of faith in the strategy here again). And some of the same roles have been announced as vacant, looking to be filled in. 
I am not sure I understand.

Also the last whole affair was really badly managed; were middle managers (who know their staff's jobs and their constraints best) actually consulted before it was decided at top level to go for it?

Exec team: (question 10 ) No communication, or hardly any. And an open office doesn&acirc;€™t seem to change much to this. We used to have regular staff meetings, which were not a day-to-day type of communication, but better than nothing. 
Where are we financially at the moment? How are we doing? What are we trying to do? Where are we going to? We don&acirc;€™t know.
&acirc;€œMaking IT good for society&acirc;€ doesn&acirc;€™t cut it on a day-to-day basis.
Also: 12 directors, 7 on the Institute side, 3 (we haven&acirc;€™t seen Matthew Piddington for a little while and Khalid Aziz is interim) on the L&amp;D side. Is this balanced enough to assess the Group's situation and take us forward?

Reorganization: What is the difference between &acirc;€œDirector of Public Affairs&acirc;€ and &acirc;€œDirector of External Affairs&acirc;€? Wouldn&acirc;€™t those roles fall under the function of &acirc;€œDirector of Community and Policy&acirc;€?
There may be very good reasons why those roles exist and why the Institute is structured as such; however as it hasn&acirc;€™t been communicated, we do not know.

Salaries: our salaries will not change at the moment, and may maybe be reassessed at the end of the financial year.  Actually I am not talking of a real increase, a bonus, but a mere alignment on the inflation.
In the meantime the actual inflation is 2.7% and my council tax has increased by nearly 5% this year. So effectively our salaries have decreased. A 3% salary increase or not doesn&acirc;€™t make a lot of difference on &Acirc;&pound;80K-100k+ salaries. It does when one is on &Acirc;&pound;15K to &Acirc;&pound;20K.
So before we decide to go on the next big expansion, could we make sure first that we have enough to guarantee actual staff an alignment on the inflation at least, for the years to come?

Work from home, BCS needs to change when it comes to working from home. The mind set is still very old fashioned and   there needs to be more flexibility from the executives.  It will save BCS costs in the long run and productivity does go up when people work from home, you are more conscious when you work from home.  It also leads to a more balances and mental balance for the staff.   

"";i:1;s:1504:""Looking around BCS there seems to be a lot of business units that could do more when it comes to savings.
1.  Stop using outside recruiters, 15% wasted paying recruitment companies whereas we have 4 staff in HR that should be doing this work. With so much social media around and so many platforms that are for free, this should be the norm to do your own recruiting. 
2. A lot of staff order food for meetings at BCS. Execs or not there should be no food ordered by staff, you would normally bring your own lunch anyway. Examples need to be set.
3. Hotels, cheapest hotels should be used, Imperial Hotels in Russel Square are just as good as the Strand Palace. 
4. Overseas travel, why? when we have skype. 
5. Marketing, using outside ad agency, I worked for one many years ago and know the costs involved. Outrageous charges and money being thrown in a black hole when we have volunteers that would be eager to help with any project. Can't continue to throw money away, photographers that cost &Acirc;&pound;500 to go up to BCS London to take some pictures where we have those skills within BCS staff to do a job just as good if not better.  
6.  Stop making good staff redundant, we have lost so many skilled staff then end up filling those roles with staff that can't cope.  e.g. customer service team is in a mess. Not a good image for BCS when we can't make the first contact that our members have a really good service.  They will stop their membership and go away where service is better.
